This lab deals with building a daily schedule in HTML, properly styling it in CSS, and adding sufficient JavaScript so that the table highlights the current day and time. Daily schedules are a fact of life. Given the complexity of remembering schedules and the potential consequences associated with making errors, daily schedule programs and devices are very common. The idea is to represent an individualâ€™s person schedule and then to enable the software to remind the user about upcoming events and the current time. Google, Apple and others offer such software systems as key elements of their software infrastructure.
